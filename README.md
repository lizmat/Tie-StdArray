NAME
====

Raku port of Perl's Tie::StdArray module

SYNOPSIS
========

    use Tie::StdArray;

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module tries to mimic the behaviour of Perl's `Tie::StdArray` module as closely as possible in the Raku Programming Language.

Tie::StdArray is a module intended to be subclassed by classes using the </P5tie|tie()> interface. It uses the standard `Array` implementation as its "backend".
